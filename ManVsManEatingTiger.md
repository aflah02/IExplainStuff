Author's View-

The work addresses the havoc caused by man-eating tigers, whose numbers have grown due to India's tiger conservation efforts. In the areas surrounding forests and reserves, such tigers run wild and are a constant source of fear for villagers. The stories of the families of people who've fallen prey are heart-breaking, be it Gopamma's family whose son, post her Husband's death, had to leave his education or the countless other families who have similar tales. The author seems to lean towards the conservatives more who want to protect Tigers at any costs even when the methods used are proved to be ineffective but also changed perspective and looks at it from the viewpoint of the villagers and recognizes the need to kill some tigers for the larger good as also proposed by Ullas Karanth. She is also startled at how the Indian society reacts differently from other societies and accepts fate but also recognizes the tipping point beyond which they no longer have patience. She is also sceptical about India's records of tigers, given their lack of other scientists' involvement.

Interpretation-

Although it is not at all possible to give a single answer about how to deal with man-eating tigers, the author seems to remain oblivious to her arguments at times. She establishes a premise with the problem but then takes a pacifist turn and does not seem to be as aggressive while countering the arguments made by pro-tiger activists who fail to see the gravity of the situation and its toll on families. She also raises an important point on how the compensation does not reach the people who need it and is stopped due to meddling middle-men and massive paperwork. She also talks about WildSeve, which is something new and a plausible solution to the compensation laundering problem if worked on more. The author provides an apt historical record about tiger hunting and the subsequent conservation effects and their aftermaths, however, to provide more historical context to the man-eating tiger issue, the example of the Champawat Tiger, which Jim Corbet hunted down, could be taken since this would give justifiable historical precedence to the actions. Her summary about the Avni case is impeccable and detailed but does not overwhelm the reader in the slightest. 

Conclusion-

Overall, the work is very enriching full of case studies, and a worthwhile read for anyone interested to delve deeper in this rabbit hole. The article also wonderfully shows how utopian ideals canâ€™t be applied in the real world especially in situations dealing with human lives.
