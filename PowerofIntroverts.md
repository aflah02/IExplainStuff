The talk by Susan Cain titled “The Power of Introverts” is a staggering reflection of our present-day society taking an exploratory dive into our society.

Susan talks about her family’s lifestyle of being engrossed in reading so they might be just a few feet apart but they could be in as distinct places as they wanted to be in their minds. During Susan’s Camp visit focus was on being ‘Rowdie’ which was ironically spelled wrong in their cheer and she didn’t get to read books and felt guilty but everyone nearby advised her against them. She grew up to be a Wall Street Lawyer to show the world that even she could be extroverted. She points out that it’s the loss of the introvert along with the colleagues, the community and even the world as almost half of the world’s population is introverted.

Then comes the difference between shyness (fear of social judgement) and introversion (response to social stimulus). Extroverts like social stimulus and most institutions cater to them. Schools encourage group-work and make introverted people feel they’re lacking due to the new belief system which says big ideas come from places which have “oddly gregarious settings”.

Introverts are suited for leadership as they let their employees explore more whereas extroverts might end up putting their own stamps on thing. Leaders such as Gandhi are said to have been introverts. It was difficult for them to be in the spotlight but they still lead movements.
Even her friends and husband are extroverts. There is no perfect extrovert or introvert, such a person would be best suited for an asylum. Some lie in the middle and are called ambiverts. We need to strike a balance between them. Thinkers such as Darwin preferred to work in solitude. Even world’s major religions have had seekers who went into wilderness for major revelations.

Contemporary psychology shows people mimic others in groups and follow the most dominant personality even though it has no correlation with good ideas. A better alternative would be to work individually and then discuss in a group.

Earlier people used to value moral rectitude and inner-selves. Self-help books were titled “Character, the Grandest Thing in the World". Then people moved to cities and charismatic people often scored over others. Hence our institutions were modelled after them. Group culture is very important but this shouldn’t snatch people’s power to work alone.

Then she showcases the books in her suitcase which belonged to her Grandfather who was a Rabbi for 62 year. He used to take his week’s reading and present them combined with ancient and humanist thoughts blended with intricate tapestries as well. When he passed away roads had to be closed to accommodate the crowd. He had a huge impact on people despite being an introvert.

Then she shares her 7-year book writing journey. She researched, wrote, read and repeated and then all of a sudden, she has to talk to promote the book which is a huge transformation.

Finally, she concludes giving 3 key-points, firstly stop the madness for group work, secondly, explore the wilderness and finally about the suitcase, for every person it might be different but whatever is in there she hopes it is shared with rest of the world for them to get aid.
